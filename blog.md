## ***Week 1*** 

#### In my first week at bootcamp, I was expecting some nerves and confusion. However, once I got in and started learning with the other bootcampers, I felt more confortable and excited for the upcoming months. I'm excited to learn more about Git, and from what I have heard from my peers, I am looking forward to studying javascript. One thing you could learn about me from reading this blog is I have a 1 year old black lab named Sokka.
